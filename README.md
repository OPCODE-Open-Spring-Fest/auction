# SMART BID

## Introduction ‚ú®

"SmartBid" is blockchain based auction like system that offers enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency compared to traditional methods. In a blockchain-based auction, each item or asset up for bidding is represented as a unique digital token on the blockchain. Participants in the auction can place bids and view the entire bid history in real-time, ensuring transparency and trust in the process.
